# PROFESSIONAL README GENERATOR

Any professional app should always include a high-quality README.  It should include the purpose of the app, how to use the app, the installation procedure, how to report issues, contributors, and how others can also contribute to the project.

This professional README generator can create a README by using a command-line application to generate one.  This will ensure that the developer can then devote more time to working on their project!

# USER STORY

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly and easily create a high-quality README file

GIVEN a command-line app that accepts user input,
WHEN I am prompted to provide information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project, the sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation Instructions, Usage Information, Contributors, How to Contribue, and Tests.
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled questions with a link to my GitHub profile.
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
